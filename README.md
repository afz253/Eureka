# PRM Algorithm for 2D Motion Planning

## Overview

This Python script implements the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm to solve a 2D motion planning problem in an environment containing triangular obstacles. The script generates a roadmap of valid paths, searches for a path from a start to a goal configuration, and applies path shortcutting for optimization.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `pylab`
- `networkx`
- `sklearn`

Make sure to install these packages if you haven’t already:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx scikit-learn
```
### Key Parameters

- `num_samples`: Number of random nodes to sample in the environment.
- `connection_radius`: Maximum distance to connect nodes in the roadmap.
- `step_size`: Step size for finer collision checking.
- `max_rep`: Number of repetitions for path shortcutting.

## Acknowledgements

This implementation is based on the PRM algorithm and the example code provided in the OSR robotics path planning documentation (https://www.osrobotics.org/osr/planning/introduction.html)
